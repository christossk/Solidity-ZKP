Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) Library
This library provides an implementation of a zero-knowledge proof system that can be used to prove the truth of a statement without revealing any information about the statement itself. ZKP can be used to improve privacy and scalability in decentralized applications.

The library is written in Solidity and provides the following files:

ZKP.sol: The main library file that provides full ZKP functionality.
ZKPParameters.sol: Defines the public parameters of the ZKP system and provides functions for performing elliptic curve arithmetic using these parameters.
Circuit.sol: Defines the circuit to be proved in the ZKP protocol and provides functions for adding gates to the circuit and computing the output values given the input values.
Prover.sol: Implements the code that generates a proof of knowledge for a given input to the circuit.
Verifier.sol: Implements the code that verifies the proof generated by the prover.
Helpers.sol: Provides helper functions to help with the implementation of the prover and verifier.
ExampleUsage.sol: Provides an example usage of the library, including how to define a circuit, how to generate a proof, and how to verify a proof.
TestZKP.sol: A file providing tests to ensure the correctness of the library.

Getting Started
To get started with the library, you can simply clone the repository and import the necessary files into your Solidity contract:

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./ZKP.sol";

You can then use the library to define a circuit, generate a proof, and verify the proof, as shown in the ExampleUsage.sol file.

Testing
To run the tests, first ensure that you have Truffle and Ganache installed. Then, navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following command:

truffle test

This will run the tests defined in the TestZKP.sol file and output the results in the console.

Security Considerations
The library has been designed to be secure, but it is important to understand the potential security risks when using a zero-knowledge proof system. In particular, it is important to ensure that the public parameters have been generated using a trusted setup process, and that the circuit to be proved does not leak any sensitive information.
